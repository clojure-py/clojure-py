//! Thin static dispatchers — Clojure's `RT.*` cross-roads.
//!
//! Each helper is one line: a `dispatch!` through the corresponding
//! protocol method. Type-specific behavior lives in the protocol's
//! built-in fallback or in per-type `implements!` blocks, never here.
//! Helpers return `Value` uniformly so that throwable-Value exceptions
//! propagate unobstructed; numeric extraction (`.as_int()`) happens at
//! the leaf call site.
